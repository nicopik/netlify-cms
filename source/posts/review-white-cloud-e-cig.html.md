White Cloud Electronic Cigarettes is a Florida-based companythat began to manufacture its acclaimed product in 2008. Its founders dove into the e-cig business after viewing them at a Las Vegas trade show. According to Forbes, each of the company'sfounders enjoys vaping! 

While nicotine isn't as healthy as eating an apple, it is what attracts many traditional smokers to e-cigs. While e-cigs offer nicotine, they do not bum, so they do not come with the health risks related to tar, smoke, and ash. While there are other up and coming e-cig brands on the market, White Cloud and its characteristic white puffs are a premier brand and their products have been featured by other major media outlets like CNBC. 

## Available Products

As one would expect from a leading e-cig brand, White Cloud offers various products including disposables (great for people who just want to give the brand a try), starter kits, e-cig cartridges, chargers, batteries, adapters, and a myriad of accessories. If you are new to the White Cloud product, consider a basic starter kit. The White Cloud website provides descriptions of their products, but the kits are an economical way to introduce yourself to the White Cloud experience if you're ready to move beyond their disposable products.  

White Cloud Batteries Batteries like the White Cloud Cirrus 3 offer a long-lasting vaping experience, but are uniquely small—a hallmark trait of White Cloud batteries This is one reason why traditional smokers feel more at home vaping a White Cloud Cirrus 3 e-cigarette; it simply feels similar in one's hand to a tobacco cigarette. Consumers can purchase either white or brushed metal batteries depending on the look they prefer. Moreover, battery skins can also be purchased and are popular with fans of the brand.

Aside from tobacco flavors, White Cloud also boasts rich flavors like Menthol, Iced Berry, Snap (a mix of mint and chocolate—hello!), Zero K (zingy peppermint), Strawberry, Banana, Espresso, Chocolate, Cinnamon, Clove, and many more. Their cartridge offerings and flavors are top-notch.
