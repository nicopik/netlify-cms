Vape pens started out as e-cigarettes more than a decade ago. Hailed as a safe method to quit smoking, they mimic the smoker's natural actions while allowing the user gradually to reduce the amount of nicotine inhaled. 

A vape pen contains a small inner coil which slowly heats a nicotine or oil concentrate that creates a vapor which the smoker inhales. People like them because they are discreet and easy to use. Due to the recent marketing boom aimed at nicotine users and the proliferation of oil concentrates, some have found a way to take advantage of the convenience of vape pens. Now vaporizer pens are turning up in drug busts around the nation, and the steady rise of abuse is sending masses of people to the emergency room. 

Modern vape pens can work in conjunction with multiple substances. The original intention was to allow cigarette smokers to switch to vape pens, then gradually reduce the nicotine concentration to wean themselves off the habit. 

Although marketed as a safe alternative without all the additional chemicals, modern synthetic drugs and oil concentrates are the perfect marriage for vape pens that pose an incredible risk for users. These synthetic drugs come in oil, wax and crystal form and the modern vape pens can accommodate all three variations. 

People are distracted by the convenience and the ability to use them out in the open. Many of the popular substances currently used in vape pens are much more dangerous than people realize. Here are some of the common elements found in vape pens and some a their dangers. 

## Red Food Dye No. 4

Red food dye No. 4 is commonly known as cochineal extract or carmine. This substance derives from insects. and the Center for Science in the Public Interest found that it causes a severe allergic reaction and anaphylactic shock in many people. Because of the increasing number of allergic reactions, a synthetic counterpart derived from plants has replaced its used in many products. The government lists this product as an inhalation hazard which causes wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and burning in the mouth or throat. This material is poisonous and highly combustible. It contaminates all surfaces it comes in contact with. 

1. Cause wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath
2. Causes convulsions, allergic reactions and anaphylactic shock
3. Poisonous and highly combustible 
4. Burning in the mouth or throat 
5. Contaminates surfaces it comes in contact

## Artificial Flavorings

Artificial flavorings are popular in vape pens. People love flavoring their va pes with cinnamon, vanilla or even popcorn for a distinctive taste in every puff. The problem is that these artificial flavorings are dangerous Many flavors contain diethylene glycol, a toxic substance found in antifreeze, along with many other toxic chemicals. These chemicals kill cells and cause addative stress in the ones it leaves behind so they don't function properly. Long-term use also causes inflammation and tissue damage. 

Studies found that combining multi ple flavorings poses a higher-risk and generates significantly more damage. These substances contain irritants, genotoxins and known carcinogens. Evidence suggests that adjusting the heating element in the vape pen converts the propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.  Contain toxic substances, including diethylene glycol Causes inflammation and tissue damage Kills cells and induces oxidative stress Combining multiple flavors poses a higher risk.

## Nicotine

Nicotine delivers adverse health effects, regardless of the delivery method. However, the concentrated forms found in vape pens and e-cigarettes are highly toxic, and doctors see an increasing number of overdoses in young people. It is also a stimulant that affects your heart and oxygen delivery through the blood vessels Regularly vaping nicotine doubles your risk of heart attack. Controlled studies also show that routine vaping can stiffen the heart muscle and blood vessels, increasing the long-term risk of heart disease. Nicotine vapors contain some of the same metals as conventional cigarettes in addition to other dangerous substances like arsenic and chromium. 

1. Doubles risk of heart attack 
2. Stiffens heart muscle increasing the risk of heart disease 
3. Concentrated forms of nicotine are highly toxic 
4. Contains arsenic, chromium and metals found in conventional cigarettes 

## Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 

Polyethylene glycol is a compound that has many uses. Depending on its molecular weight at the time, it is used as an industrial surfactant, as a laxative, in ointments and cosmetics. Overheating this compound can cause an explosion when exposed to individual elements or contaminations. Polyethylene glycol is a toxic ingredient found in antifreeze, and it produces the lethal compound ethylene glycol when processed. Often used as a binder in technical ceramics, it converts to formaldehyde at the right tern perature. 

Commonly used as industrial surfactant and laxative. Overheating can cause an explosion when specific contaminants are present. A toxic ingredient found in antifreeze converts to formaldehyde at the right temperature 

## Propylene Glycol (PG)

Propylene glycol is technically an alcohol that has many different uses. It is a solvent that attracts water, used in everything from cosmetics to antifreeze. However, that doesn't make it safe to inhale at concentrated levels, During tests, when rats got exposed to limited amounts of propylene glycol vapor, their noses bled. A subsequent short-term study on human volunteers showed that exposure to propylene glycol vape irritated the upper airways, coughing and a decrease in the measure of airway obstruction. The most notable effect is inflammation and cell death or toxicity, but PG also converts to formaldehyde at a higher temperature.  

## Used in antifreeze

Causes airway irritation and obstruction Causes inflammation and cell toxicity Converts to formaldehyde at a higher temperature Vegetable Glycerin (VG) Many napes on the market are vegetable glycerin based.
