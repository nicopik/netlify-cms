Can buying vape pen cartridges can be satisfying for First-Time Vape Users and Moving Product? Learn More... 

Vape pens, as opposed to high-performance vaping devices, will always be first point-of-access for people who trying to quit smoking cigarettes. They not only resemble cigarettes, but also are small, portable, pre-filled and pre-flavored. They don't need a several-page instruction manual for the user to smoke: there's no bulky battery case with variable voltage controls and no replaceable atomizer to get burned out and replaced.

Most vape pens consist simply of the battery and a cartridge that both holds the liquid and vaporizes it. Just take it out of the package and it's ready to go. Every store has a percentage of regulars who drop by to try the new juices, fire up their monster high-performance device, and blast a thick cloud of smoke into the air. But these are in the minority. Stores usually see smokers thinking of quitting and first-timers who don't want something complicated. 

These are the types who stop in "just to have a look around." And they buy vape pens.  Usually, they gravitate toward pre-filled vape pen cartridges. Nothing fancy, nothing complicated, nothing that makes a mess. 

The extra step of unscrewing a cartridge and dripping in the juice can make first-timers lose interest in "aping and easily cost people who would have become long term, repeat customers and eventually graduate to refillable cartridges or tanks. 

Smokers want cigarette flavors: menthol, tobacco, rich tobacco, etc. First-timers want the exotic fruity, dessert, and chocolate flavors to make vaping tasty. Keeping both in stock and readily available can be a challenge. 

This is an industry where the force of habit, not new experiences, rules the day, yet hundreds of new flavors and device types debut each year. The solution to keeping new products for first-time vape users and refillable cartridges moving off the shelf isn't a different strategy in buying cartridges wholesale.
