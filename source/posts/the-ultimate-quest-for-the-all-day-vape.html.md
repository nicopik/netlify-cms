Once every vaper begins his or her vaping journey, they embark on the ultimate quest to find their All Day Vape (ADV). This is the flavor that becomes your go-to flavor. It's the one that you absolutely must taste at least once during your day. It's the one you make sure you never, ever-run out of. Perhaps you can relate, and you've been on a journey of your own. 

The question is, how do you find the e-juice that's everything you ever could have hoped for in an e-juice? How do you find the right mix, with the right PG/VG ratio that satisfies you all day long, and well into the evening? While this is a journey that's different for everyone, here are a few tips to help you get started.

## Tip #1: Be adventurous 

Many newbie vapers make the mistake of assuming that they're going to enjoy tobacco-flavored e-juice, or menthol-flavored e-juice because of the type of cigarettes they smoke. While some vapers are very content with tobacco and menthol flavors, most of them find that they taste very different from cigarettes. 

Don't be afraid to step outside your comfort zone, especially when you're just a beginner. For example, let's say you absolutely hate oranges. You avoid orange juice at all costs, and you can't even stand to be in the same room as someone who is peeling an orange However, once you try a citrus-flavored e-juice, you might be pleasantly surprised to find that the flavor graces your-palate very differently than the actual fruit does. 

Try e-juice from different groupings to find what seems to suit you the most - coffee flavors, bakery flavors and even candy flavors are all excellent choices, and your ADV might just be lying within their midst. 

## Tip #2: Be creative 

If you've tried a variety of different e-juices, and you still haven't found one you would consider your ADV, there's nothing wrong with putting your creativity to work. Some flavors work even better when they're combined. Of course, it's always a good idea to start slowly. 

You wouldn't want to mix a large batch of chocolate and strawberry only to find that those two particular flavors don't blend well, even though they sounded good when you started. Try small amounts at first, and see if you can come up with a creation that's all your own. You can also do some research and find out some more information about making your own &juice right at home. 

Many vapers find that preferable because it allows them more room to experiment and find something they really like.  Finally, it's important for you to be patient while you're searching for your ADV. Patience is an absolute must when it comes to vaping.
