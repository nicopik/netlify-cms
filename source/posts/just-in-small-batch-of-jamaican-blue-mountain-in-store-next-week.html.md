The advent of e-cigarettes is shaking up the tobacco industry. In January 2019, PM International, the maker of Marlboro, Parliament, Chesterfield, Virginia Slims, L&M, and many other tobacco cigarette brands, announced plans to stop producing tobacco cigarettes and shift its operations to smoke-free products instead. 

Even with the newfound popularity for vaping, though, nearly 38 million Americans still smoke cigarettes. If you're among this crowd, you should consider switching to vaping for the seven following reasons. 

## It's Better for Your Health 

Vaping is a safer way to consume nicotine than smoking. Tobacco cigarettes contain about 600 ingredients that, when burned, create over 10,000 chemicals.

With each puff you take, you'll breathe toxic cigarette chemicals like ammonia, formaldehyde and carbon monoxide into your lungs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cocktail of toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke is responsible for nearly half-million deaths in the United States each year. 

E-juice, which is the liquid used in e-cigarettes, contains only a few basic ingredients, such as food vegetable glycol, propylene glycol, and nicotine. And because e-cigarettes don't bum anything, they don't create other toxic chemicals. E-juice may still contain nicotine, which can be addictive, but nicotine is generally safe and doesn't cause or contribute to any chronic disease. 

## You'll Save Money

Smoking isn't just bad for your health, it's expensive. In the United States, the cost of tobacco cigarettes has increased dramatically over the past few decades. Depending on where you live, you can now expect to pay $5 to $12 for a single pack. If you smoke two packs a day, you'll spend about $3,650 to $8,760 per year on this bad habit. In addition to cigarettes, you'll also spend more money on lighters, ashtrays, breath mints and clothes when smoking. 

In reality, the cost of smoking is much higher than that. Smokers typically get sick more frequently than nonsmokers, forcing them to spend more money on medical bills while taking time off from work in the process.
