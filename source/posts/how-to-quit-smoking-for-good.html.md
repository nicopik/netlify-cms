Most people are now aware of the effects smoking has on a person's health and more people are actively trying to quit than ever before. However, as with any addiction, quitting is far from easy. Thankfully, one of the biggest hurdles is simply deciding you're ready to stop. These simple tips will help to improve your chances of success by making the entire process more manageable and, therefore, easier to tackle. 

## Motivation  

Honestly, motivation is important if you're to achieve long-term success Consider the reasons why you want to stop smoking and what tangible effects quitting would have on your life. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you, but delve deeper to get a more comprehensive understanding of what smoking cigarettes actually does to your body. The more knowledge you gain, the more determined you will likely become in your desire to quit. 

Apply the facts and figures surrounding smoking to your own life. For instance, improving your lung capacity could mean you are able to enjoy more of the physical activities you enjoy. Put the potential benefits into real terms that apply directly to your life so that your incentives are more meaningful. 

## Alternatives  

Don't make the process of quitting harder than it needs to be by ignoring alternatives that may be helpful. There are many ways to ease the effects of quitting cigarettes. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a particularly popular technique that has helped many people stop smoking. NRT involves receiving a relatively tiny dose of nicotine in place of smoking a cigarette to help wean yourself away from the addiction. 

NRT doesn't have to be formally prescribed and can come in the form of lozenges, gum, sprays, tablets and &cigarettes. Find an alternative that you like and use it if you think it will help. There is no need to go cold turkey as you can still reap the benefits of abstaining from the many other harmful components of traditional cigarettes while managing your medical addiction to nicotine in a controlled and effective manner. 

## Support 

Statistically, people who have strong emotional support are much more likely to successfully quit than those who go through the process alone. Speak to family and friends and ask for their support. Most people are more than happy to help. If you don't have close friends or family to call on, you can still contact your local health authority to be put in contact with other people in the same situation. 

You can even 'buddy-up' with other quitters. There are many groups and organizations dedicated to helping people find others to quit with. Ask at your local health centre or-simply search online for quitting groups. Once you've found people to quit with, you can share experiences and discuss any setbacks or successes you're likely to have along the way. Having someone to talk to will provide reassurance and enable you to rediscover your motivation and discipline when times are at their most challenging.
