Choosing cigars is all about knowing what the various cigar wrappers, or outer leaves, bring to the table. A cigar's wrapper isn't the only thing that determines its taste (binder and filler tobacco also do so), but the wrapper does have the largest impact on the sensations experienced by the smoker. 

This post is an introduction to cigars' wrappers and sizes. Includes descriptions of the four most common wrappers, information pertaining to sizes and ring gauge. and much else. Factually sound and genuinely helpful, the piece was written by a longtime tobacco enthusiast with a deep understanding of stogies.

Connecticut cigars are light in color and in body, and they typically produce smooth, mild smoking experiences It's recommended that first-time smokers initiate their tobacco careers by lighting a Connecticut. 

Corojo cigars are darker than Connecticut cigars and lighter than Maduro cigars. Predominantly grown in Honduras Corojo wrappers feature more body and pep than Connecticut wrappers, but less strength than Maduro wrappers. Corojo cigars' flavors are generally sharper than those of Connecticut cigars. 

Habano cigars look similar to Corojo sticks, but they come equipped with spicier flavors and greater amounts of nicotine; having originated in Cuba, they've been mostly grown in Nicaragua for the last 60 years. Some smokers-and cigarmakersâ€”maintain that Habano wrappers, when carefully blended with complementary filler and binder tobaccos, outshine other cigar wrappers 

Maduro cigars are dark-colored and full-bodied. Maduro tobacco is blackened through sun exposure, and as a rule, Maduro stogies are hearty. New smokers should remember to bum Maduro sticks slowly, as they pack quite a punch, and their deep, rich flavors are at their best when given time to mellow and expand throughout the palette. 

There're several other wrapper types besides those described here, but the listed four are the main four, and most cigars can be classified as Connecticut Corojo, Habano, or Maduro. With a little experience, knowledge pertaining to cigars' wrappers will become second nature. The same is true of cigars' sizes and shapes.
