Pipe smoking is about the only socially acceptable way left to practice the ancient art of burning the ancient leaf. Most of us know at least one or two guys (and even, more rarely, women) who smoke a pipe, and few seem to find any fault with their hobby. In fact, most pipe smokers seem to fall into that type of personality that people actively enjoy being around them while they smoke. If you have a pipe smoker on your gift list and you want to give them a present that they would enjoy and appreciate, while not breaking your gift-giving budget, here are some ideas that you can consider. 

First of all, forget buying a pipe for them. Not only is a decent pipe, worthy of a present, going to cost in the $250 to $500 range (and up, into the thousands), but the choice of a pipe is about as personal to a smoker as the choice of aftershave. Shape, size, material, finish, type of bit -unless you're a pipe smoker yourself, you can't image the complexity or variety of pipes. Don't worry, though: Pipe smoking involves a wide range of ancillary gear (which is half the fun of pipe smoking), any of which can make for a present they'll appreciate.

If you live in a large city, there will be a selection of tobacconists or pipe stores still left where you can find any of these suggested gifts. Or, you can go onto the Internet and search for the online version of a pipe store; there are at least a dozen really good sites and they're easy to find. If you want to take the trouble to find something rare or unique, trythe online auction sites. It takes a little effort, but with enough time you'll find a special and memorable gift. 

## Tamper 

As pipe tobacco bums in a pipe bowl, it tends to expand a little. To keep it properly lit, a pipe smoker has to gently tamp it down. While a thumb or index finger will do the job, most pipe smokers use a tamper. These are usually less than half an inch in diameter, 3 or 4 inches long and are flat on one end. The common multi-tool that combines tamper, scraper and wire stem cleaner are useless as a gift. Instead, look for a tamper made of some exotic wood, antler tine, cast metal with a figure on top, even hand-blown glass. $25 to $45. 

## 
Limited Edition Tobacco 

Blends The choice of a tobacco blend fora pipe smoker is usually about as individual as his selection of a pipe, but most pipe smokers are adventurous enough to be Wiling to occasionallytry something new. There's a popular tradition of annual tobacco mixtures, offered seasonallyfor a limited time by some of the most famous tobacco blenders, packaged in old-fashioned beautifully designed tins. 

Some, like Samuel Gowith, are just called the "annual edition" while others are called Christmas or holiday blends, and are unique each year. Look for such brands as Peterson, McClelland, Cornell & Diehl and W.O. Larson. If you can, see if you can get blends from earlier years: Like wine, pipe tobacco ageswell in sealed tins. $25 to $35. 

## Pipe Cleaner Sleeve 

Those fuzz-covered pieces of wire aren't just for making elementary school craft projects; they really are used to clean pipes. Every pipe smoker needs a good supply of them to keep his pipe drawing cleanly, without that strangely disturbing gurgling sound. As part of all the gear that pipe smokers need, a place to keep spare pipe cleaners is a must.
