E-cigarettes and vape mods are both used for e-smoking (also known as vaping). To help you decide which might suit you best, we've broken down the main difference between these two categories so you can choose with confidence. 

## E-cigarettes 

E-cigarette (also known as an e-cig or vape pen) is an all-in-one e-smoking solution. Although they're not very adaptable, they are convenient and easy to use. The bulkier models are often as large as a cigar but you can also find slimline products that are sized similarlyto a conventional cigarette. 

Inside the unit, there's a battery, a small heating coil, a vaporizer and a reservoir containing the e-liquid or "smoke juice". This fluid is a mix of vegetable glycerine and propylene glycol (or sometimes one of these fluids alone), along with other ingredients. 

Additional ingredients may include nicotine to produce a tobacco-like physiological response; colorings to make the fluid look more appealing; and flavorings that provide a more pleasant vaping experience. This mixture is heated to produce a vapor, which is then inhaled by the user. 

## Vape mods 

More powerful than vape pens, vape mods may operate in a similar way to a vape pen but are designed to provide the user with more control. Fans of vape mods (also known as mechanical vape mods) cite an improved smoke-like sensation when inhaling the vapor and better, more intense flavors. 

On the downside, e-cigarettes don't provide much in the way of user control. They tend to have a single temperature setting and some users feel that they give a less pleasant vaping experience in terms of sensation and flavor. 

## Pros and cons 

The pros of e-cigarettes are that they're small, compact and easy to use. They're very convenient â€” easy to slip into your bag or pocket. They also tend to be much less expensive than vape mods, especially if you choose a more basic model. 

The main pro of a vape mod is that it allows the user a significant degree of control. They can choose the temperature and otherfactors affecting the amount, density and flavor of the vapor produced by the unit. In the cons column, the size and weight of a vape mod will generally be much larger. 

With its larger battery, a vape mod is typically much bulkier and more cumbersome than even the chunkiest e-cigarettes. Other major disadvantage is the price: vape mods are dramatically more expensive than e-cigarettes, making them more of a risk for a first-time buyer.
