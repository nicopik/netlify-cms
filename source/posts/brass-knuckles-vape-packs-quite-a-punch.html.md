Unless you've been living under a rock for the past zo years, there's a good chance you've heard about the health benefits of vaping nicotine as opposed to smoking cigarettes. But what many people may not realize is that there is a growing mountain of evidence to suggest that getting your cannabis dosage via vape, as opposed to rolling up an old-school joint, may have its fair share of benefits as well. 

Aside from the obvious advantages like smelling fresher and not needing to keep a lighter on you at all times there is some serious scientific study mounting surrounding the act of smoking anything—even a genuinely beneficial substance like cannabis—and the overall health and integrity of your lungs But consuming marijuana with the use of a vape pen actually exposes your lungs to next to none of the in-itants and toxins that smoking will. And that means you get access to all of those beneficial cannabinoids without a single potential carcinogen. 

For patients with sensitive lungs simply aren't a big fan of coughing fits after a deep inhale, vaping offers the added perk of allowing users to inhale less "smoke," as well. 
Another benefit to vaping that might come as a surprise to some is just how much money it can save over the long run, too. Many people have mistaken preconceived notions about just how much a vaping set up can cost initially.

And even those who choose a higher end initial investment will save over the course of time by switching to vaping over-traditional smoking. Consider this - Each puff from a vaping device is saving you money over a drag off a traditional joint, if only by virtue of the fact that it's delivering far more into your system. 

And if you're using cannabis for a specific function, like pain or anxiety relief, then studies show that vaping can help you get there much faster than smoking or even consuming edibles. In fact, whether you look to pot for stress relief, nausea, to stimulate your-appetite or simply for recreational purposes, it can sometimes feel like that wonder plant wants to take its sweet time getting to work. For those looking for near-instant relief, it doesn't get much quicker than vaping. 

It doesn't take much to see why vape pens are quickly rising among the most popular delivery methods for cannabis products in legal states. But with so many options to choose from, how do you know which brands of batteries and refill cartridges offer consistent, quality experiences?

One way is to find recognized brands with well-documented reviews. Setting an industry standard for high quality prefilled THC cartridges, Brass Knuckles vape pens are an incredibly popular choice, especially along the west coast.
