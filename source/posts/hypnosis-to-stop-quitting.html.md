Gone are the days when hypnosis was seen as little more than a magician's smoke and minors trick. In recent decades it has become respected in scientific, clinical communities for its ability to reach and influence a patient's subconscious mind. This in turn can address a person's attitudes, beliefs and imaginative associations to many problems at their source. The result can be a change in one's thinking and subsequent behavior. Among many modern treatments available to people who want to quit smoking, hypnosis has proven to be one of most effective — even more so than nicotine patches or gum. 

Generally, hypnotism is used to help people work through their fears and relax and feel less stressed. This in itself can relate to a smoker's struggles around quitting, because many people cite stress as one of their chief reasons for smoking in first place. But hypnotism can do more than simply induce a state of relaxation. It can actually move you beyond gates of your conscious mind—the place in psyche where judgments are made —and into subconscious mind where your underlying beliefs have a life of their own. The subconscious mind responds to our conscious suggestions (or to suggestions of a hypnotist) without question. Thus, if you're able to envision yourself as being someone who never smokes then your subconscious will accep this vision as reality.
