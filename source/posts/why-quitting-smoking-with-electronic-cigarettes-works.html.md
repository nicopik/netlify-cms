If you have been smoking for any period of time, you've probably also tried to quit at least once. For many people, quitting smoking is a goal that's difficult to reach. It can be discouraging to have friends and family members who seem to be able to quit without much difficulty at all because it leaves you feeling like you've done something wrong. 

You might even begin to feel that something is wrong with you because quitting is so difficult, if not impossible. The fact is that quitting smoking is harder for some people than others. The good news is that there is a new quitting method on the market that is able to help more smokers quit than any other nicotine replacement treatment. 

Electronic cigarettes have helped thousands of people quit smoking for-many reasons, and they can help you too. 

## Reason #1: Electronic Cigarettes Mimic Smoking 

As a smoker, you understand that there's something relaxing about inhaling smoke and exhaling it again. In addition to the calming effects of the nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes, the fad is that smoking gives you several opportunities to remove yourself from the stress you face every day. 

This behavior in itself is addictive, and it's one reason many people have such a hard time quitting cold turkey, or switching to a prescription quit method like the gum or the patch. Electronic cigarettes allow you to continue to take those breaks during the day, and you also get to "smoke". The difference is that the vapor you inhale and exhale doesn't contain any of the dangerous chemicals or tar that cigarette smoke does. 

## Reason #2: The Flavors are Enticing 

Have you ever thought about what your cigarettes taste like? Most smokers don't. They smoke out of habit, and they get used to the taste after a period of time. However, the next time you light up, really think about how the smoke tastes. One of the best parts of electronic cigarettes is the variety of e-juice flavors that are currently available. 

There are thousands of online manufacturers, as well as brick and mortar stores that sell their own in-house e-juices. Most electronic cigarette users (or vapers) are eager to sing the praises of their favorite juices, which quickly allow them to realize how terrible their traditional cigarettes really taste. 

## Reason #3: Control over Intake

E-cigarettes give You the Benefits of, and the Control Over Nicotine. Even though nicotine is addictive, it has many beneficial elements to it too. Science has proven that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. Nicotine has also been shown to be responsible for-increasing the growth rate of new blood vessels, which has led to several advances in treatments for diabetic patients.
