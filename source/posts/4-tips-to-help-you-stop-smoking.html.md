Whether you started smoking because of stress or curiosity, it can become hard to stop once you have started. However, even though it has become an addiction, there is still a chance for you to cut off your unhealthy habit.  If you want to stop, here are some tips that you should consider-. 

## Create Your Goals 

When it comes to fulfilling a task, one of the best ways to be consistent is by having the proper motivation. If you think that breaking your smoking habits can become a complicated process, you can ease it up by listing the goals that you have in mind.  If you can, you should also try to create a reward system as you list the things that you want to accomplish. When you reach a particular date since you stopped smoking, you can treat yourself to an item or activity that you have always wanted. 

## Find a Hobby 

If you aspire to distract yourself from the thoughts of smoking, you should look for an event that can get your attention. While you may think that it will not fit your schedule, there are a variety of hobbies that you can try out.  Have you ever wanted to try out a sport? What kind of recreational activities do you enjoy? If you use up your time on your new hobbies, it will be easier for you to keep your hands off a cigarette pack. 

## De-stress 

One of the main reasons why people smoke is stress. If you are one of them, then you should prioritize eradicating pressure from your life. When you are feeling frustrated because of an event, you should take deep breaths before doing anything else.  In times of stress, you should do breathing exercises instead of reaching for a cigarette. Since you cannot control how every single day wll go, you can at least manage your mentality. Each day may not be the best, but you should still maintain a positive outlook. 

## Increase Your Water Intake 

Drinking water brings with it a long list of benefits and preventing smoking habits is one of them. When you drink a lot of water, you can help to flush out the remaining nicotine in your body.
