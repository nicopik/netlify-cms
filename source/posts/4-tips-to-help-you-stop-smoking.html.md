You've probably heard this before: "I can give up any time I want. I just smoke because it's enjoyable." Habitual smokers often tell their friends they aren't hooked and engage in their daily habit out of choice. The latest news, though, shows all it takes is one cigarette to make you addicted to a regular nicotine rush. If you're curious about smoking and contemplating giving it a try; think again. Don't get taken in by the boasts of forty-a-day smokers who tell you your first puff isn't a big deal. 

According to studies in the US, UK, New Zealand, and Australia 68.9% of people who try smoking become daily smokers. Results prove that while some people can resist, most take up the cigarette habit after their first smoke.  The dangers of experimenting with a cigarette because you're curious or want to join in with friends are clear. You need to take responsibility for your health and make an informed decision. Your friends aren't genetically the same as you, and if they say a few puffs won't be harmful, they might be wrong. 

You could be like the majority of people who tum from non-smokers into daily smokers after a single cigarette. The research stems from an analysis of responses from 215,000 people to eight surveys over six years. It's the first time big data's established a connection between a single smoke and becoming a regular smoker.  What slicking does to your body.

Whether you started smoking because of stress or curiosity, it can become hard to stop once you have started. However, even though it has become an addiction, there is still a chance for you to cut off your unhealthy habit.  If you want to stop, here are some tips that you should consider-. 

## Create Your Goals

When it comes to fulfilling a task, one of the best ways to be consistent is by having the proper motivation. If you think that breaking your smoking habits can become a complicated process, you can ease it up by listing the goals that you have in mind.  If you can, you should also try to create a reward system as you list the things that you want to accomplish. When you reach a particular date since you stopped smoking, you can treat yourself to an item or activity that you have always wanted. 

## Find a Hobby

If you aspire to distract yourself from the thoughts of smoking, you should look for an event that can get your attention. While you may think that it will not fit your schedule, there are a variety of hobbies that you can try out.  Have you ever wanted to try out a sport? What kind of recreational activities do you enjoy? If you use up your time on your new hobbies, it will be easier for you to keep your hands off a cigarette pack. 

## De-stress

One of the main reasons why people smoke is stress. If you are one of them, then you should prioritize eradicating pressure from your life. When you are feeling frustrated because of an event, you should take deep breaths before doing anything else.  In times of stress, you should do breathing exercises instead of reaching for a cigarette. Since you cannot control how every single day will go, you can at least manage your mentality. Each day may not be the best, but you should still maintain a positive outlook. 

## Increase Your Water Intake

Drinking water brings with it a long list of benefits and preventing smoking habits is one of them. When you drink a lot of water, you can help to flush out the remaining nicotine in your body. In the UK alone, smoking accounts for 80,000 deaths a year. Shockingly, smoking-related diseases kill one in two smokers. Here's what can happen to you if you smoke.

Cigarette tar can thicken your blood, causing clots that make your blood pressure rise and heart overwork. Oxygen-rich blood then decreases circulation to your organs. The result is an increased risk of stroke and heart attack. Smoking can cause lung cancer, pneumonia, chronic emphysema, and bronchitis all can kill you. Even if you escape a fatal lung disease, you might have respiratory problems like asthma and wheezing. Smoking doubles the risk of stroke and increases the chances of a brain aneurysm. Blood vessel wall weakness can lead to a rupture, followed by brain damage or demise. If you're already a smoker, it's worth quitting.
