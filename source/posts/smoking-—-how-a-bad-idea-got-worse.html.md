Any resemblance between cigarettes sold today and those manufactured 5o years ago is purely coincidental. Over time, tobacco companies have manipulated their products to make them more addictive. In 1994, under extended public and political pressure, five major tobacco companies released an extensive list of the 599 additives used in the production of Amen can cigarettes.  

For more than 50 years, American tobacco companies embrace modern science to 'enhance' their products. This was addressed in the 2014 Surgeon General's Report ('The Health Consequences of Smoking — 50 Years of Progress'), which stated, 'The evidence is sufficient to conclude that the increased risk of death and disease— specifically lung cancer — results from changes in the design and composition of cigarettes since the 19505.

In addition to cigarettes, you'll also spend more money on lighters, and clothes when smoking. The possibility that E-juice may still contain nicotine. Nicotine is generally safe and doesn't cause or contribute to any chronic disease, but is addictive.  E-juice, which is liquid used in e-cigarettes, contains only a few basic ingredients, such as food vegetable glycol, propylene glycol, and nicotine. 

And because e-cigarettes don't burn anything, they don't create other toxic chemicals.  Depending on where you live, you can now expect to pay $5 to $12 for a single pack. If you smoke two packs a day, you'll spend about $3,650 to $8,760 per year on this bad habit. 

These changes had come to light in 1998, when the major tobacco companies were forced to release internal documents. These outlined industry strategies and practices, including the use of genetic modification to design tobacco crops which contained twice the usual amount of nicotine. 

A redesign of the cigarette itself produced an improved 'nicotine delivery system' which increased the effect by another 14.5 percent. 'No one has ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes without nicotine.' These were the words of W. L. Dunn, a principal scientist with Phillip Morris, in 1972. 

There are more than 100 additives from the list of 599 which either enhance addiction or mask the negative effects of cigarette smoking. Some dilate airways, making a smoker's lungs more receptive to nicotine and tar exposure.
